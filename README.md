# Starter Fullstack JS App on Glitch

This app is a scaffold to help you build full-stack single page apps using Javascript.

It uses Node/Express for the backend and API, sqlite as a simple database and React with hooks,
routing and styled component support on the frontend.


Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy 
and update live.

## Your Project

On the front-end,

- edit files in `app` folder, it contains all the React stuff
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- api controller lives in `api/controller.js`
- database stuff in `db.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
